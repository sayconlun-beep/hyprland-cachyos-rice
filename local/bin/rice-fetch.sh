# The terminal greeting: system info beside a logo that fits the window.
#
# Three things it does that plain `fastfetch` does not:
#
#  1. Picks the logo size from the CURRENT terminal width, so a narrow window
#     gets a small logo (or none) instead of wrapping the info text into
#     nonsense. fastfetch prints once and cannot reflow afterwards, which is
#     why a window resized smaller stays broken - re-run this (`fetch`) and
#     it redraws at the new size.
#
#  2. Animates, when there is a GIF at $LOGO_GIF and the terminal is kitty.
#     fastfetch cannot do this: its kitty/kitty-direct logo sends a single
#     still. `kitten icat` transmits every frame and kitty then plays them
#     ITSELF - verified: icat exits and the image keeps moving - so this
#     costs no background process and does not hold up the prompt.
#
#  3. Falls back cleanly: static PNG in kitty without a GIF, text art
#     anywhere else (sixel would need ImageMagick, which is not installed).
